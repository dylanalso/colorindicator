Thank you for using color indicator!

This program requires Python3.

To use: 
1. Open Color Indicator.pyw
2. Hover your mouse over the color on your screen.
3. Observe the ColorIndicator.pyw window.
4. NOTE: "Color Name:" gives the closest approximate value to the matching web color. "RGB Value:" gives the exact RGB value should you need to replicate the color you are looking at.
